# Daphnet-Freezing-of-Gait-Forecasting
The Repo contains the working example of time-series forecasting on Daphnet Freezing of Gait dataset

### Repo structure
 - Daphnet-Freezing-of-Gait-Dataset - Contains the dataset downloaded from UCI Database.
 - notebooks - Contains all the code file related to the project. There are saperate code files for preprocessing, EDA, and for every modeling architecture.
 - models - Contains the fully trained and tested model architectures, in a proper segrigation according to the modeling technique and the model used for it. 
 - results - Contains the final CSVs with all the accuracies and losses from training and testing of the models. 
 - Plots - Contains all the plots generated in the EDA notebook in the .PNG format. 
 - requirements.txt - Contains all the library related information, that could be utilized to recreate the project results easily. 
 
### Modeling techniques 
There are two different types of modeling techniques that are used in this project :-
 - Single target variable prediction using single instance.
 - Multiple target variable prediction using single instance.
 - Single target variable prediction using multiple instances.
 - Multiple target variable prediction using multiple instances.
